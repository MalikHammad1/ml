**Introduction**

This project focuses on solving a complex classification problem by applying advanced machine learning techniques. The dataset, *Occupancy Estimation*, comprises sensor data and aims to predict room occupancy count as a multiclass classification task. The objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

**Dataset Description**

- **Dataset Name:** Occupancy Estimation Dataset
- **Features:**
  - Sensor data: temperature, light, sound, CO2 levels, etc.
- **Target:** Room occupancy count (4 unique classes: 0, 1, 2, 3).
- **Dataset Size:** 10,000+ samples with 10+ features.

**Preprocessing**

1. **Feature Scaling:** Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature values.
1. **Missing Data:** Ensured all necessary features and target columns were present.
1. **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA was used for visualization in SVM.
1. **Class Imbalance Handling:** Stratified splitting was used for balanced training and testing sets.

**Methodology**

**Algorithms**

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   1. Tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV:

      1. min\_samples\_split: [2, 5]
   1. Optimized for f1\_weighted score.
   1. Achieved outstanding performance in handling multiclass data.
   1. Visualized a single decision tree from the forest.
1. **Logistic Regression**
   1. Configured for multiclass classification.
   1. Evaluated for standard metrics and ROC-AUC.
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   1. Trained with a linear kernel and C=1.
   1. Visualized support vectors with PCA (2D projection).
